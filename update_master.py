=====================================
This module is for updating the master files for each course.
In the end, a single master file will be created by appending all
the updates to a single file.

1. read the progress file
2. select the percent_complete column
3. append the data to the coresponding name in the master sheet.

NB: Need to make sure that names are correctly matched
- the recommended file naming convention for progress reports is to use the course code
- however it might be easier naming them by the exac course names
- if course names are used, they must be exact as those in the courselist.csv
